    <h1>Information Sheet</h1>

    <p><strong>Title of the project:</strong> Valence Asymmetries in Language, Mind &amp; Morality</p>

    <p><strong>Institution:</strong> Universitat Pompeu Fabra</p>

    <p><strong>Principal Investigator:</strong> 
        Isidora Stojanovic
    </p>

    <p><strong>Contact information:</strong> If you have doubts, you may contact the principal investigator or 
        <a href="mailto:michelle.stankovic@upf.edu">Michelle Stankovic</a>.
    </p>

    <p>If you have doubts, complaints, or questions about this study or about your rights as a research participant, you may contact UPF’s Institutional Committee for the Ethical Review of Projects (CIREP) by phone (+34 93 542 21 86) or by email (<a href="mailto:secretaria.cirep@upf.edu">secretaria.cirep@upf.edu</a>). CIREP is not part of the research team and will treat any information you send confidentially.</p>

    <p><strong>Funding body:</strong> This project is funded by the European Union (ERC Advanced Grant: Valence Asymmetries, nº 101142133)</p>

    <h2>Objectives of the project</h2>
    <p>The goal of this study is to see how people think about good and bad actions. We want to know how you decide which actions are ‘true’ or which actions you think are based on personal opinions. This could help us understand how our ideas about morality, language, and thinking are connected and how we can better communicate positive and negative social messages.</p>

    <h2>Methodology and Participation</h2>
    <p>In this study, you will be presented with different scenarios related to hypothetical situations, including responses to moral scenarios. Some moral scenarios involve sensitive topics including end-of-life decisions, abortion, and symbols associated with hate groups, which may be triggering. You will be asked about your thoughts and feelings in various situations, like what you would do in a hypothetical moral dilemma. We will ask you some questions about your moral viewpoints and ideas. There is no right or wrong answer, and your answers are completely anonymous.</p>

    <p>We will also ask you a few questions about yourself, like your age, gender, languages you speak and country you are living in.</p>

    <p>The study will take place online, and you can complete it in your own time on your own computer. The whole experiment will take approximately 20 minutes to complete.</p>

    <h2>Inclusion Criteria</h2>
    <p>We are looking for participants aged 18–65. You need to have a good understanding of English so that you can read and respond to the questions. No other knowledge is necessary.</p>

    <h2>Voluntary Participation</h2>
    <p>Your participation in this study is on a voluntary basis and you may withdraw from the study at any time without having to justify your decision.</p>

    <h2>Risks and Benefits</h2>
    <p>Participating in this study does not entail risks greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life. Apart from giving up your time, we do not expect that there will be any risks or inconveniences associated with taking part in this study. We cannot and do not guarantee that you will receive any benefits from this study.</p>

    <h2>Compensation</h2>
    <p>Your participation will be compensated through Prolific. You will be paid £3 for participating in this project for 20 minutes. Compensation requires complete participation.</p>

    <h2>Data Protection</h2>
    <p>In order to protect your privacy, we will not identify your data. This means that there will be no way to connect your responses to you, and you will be completely anonymous. The data collected during the experiment cannot be used to identify you. No one, not even the research team will be able to identify your information.</p>

    <p>Prolific will provide us your Prolific ID for payment purposes but these will be collected separately by Prolific and will not be linked to your survey responses. Therefore, once the experiment concludes, we will not be able to delete the data you generated, should you ask for it (because we will not be able to know which data is yours).</p>

    <p>Anonymized data may be hosted or published in a public repository. The results of this research may be presented at conferences or published in professional journals. You will not be identified in any results that are published or presented.</p>
